# Stellar-Save — Rotational Savings on Stellar

**A decentralized rotational savings and credit association (ROSCA) built on Stellar Soroban smart contracts.**

Stellar Save is a traditional community-based savings system where members contribute a fixed amount regularly, and each member receives the total pool on a rotating basis. This project brings this time-tested financial mechanism to the blockchain, making it transparent, trustless, and accessible globally.

## 🎯 What is Stellar-Save?

Stellar-Save is a rotating savings and credit association (ROSCA) common in Nigeria and across Africa. Members:
- Form a group with a fixed contribution amount
- Contribute the same amount each cycle (e.g., weekly or monthly)
- Take turns receiving the full pool of contributions
- Build trust and financial discipline within communities

**This Soroban implementation makes Stellar-Save:**
- ✅ Trustless (no central coordinator needed)
- ✅ Transparent (all transactions on-chain)
- ✅ Accessible (anyone with a Stellar wallet can join)
- ✅ Programmable (automated payouts, no manual coordination)

## 🚀 Features

- **Create Groups**: Set contribution amount, cycle duration, and max members
- **Join & Participate**: Members join and contribute each cycle
- **Automatic Payouts**: When all members contribute, payout executes automatically to the next recipient
- **Native XLM Support**: Built-in support for Stellar Lumens (XLM)
- **Token Ready**: Architecture supports custom Stellar tokens (roadmap item)
- **Transparent**: All contributions and payouts are verifiable on-chain

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (1.70+)
- [Soroban CLI](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/setup)
- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/stellar-cli)

### Build

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

### Test

```bash
./scripts/test.sh
```

### Deploy to Testnet

```bash
# Configure your testnet identity first
stellar keys generate deployer --network testnet

# Deploy
./scripts/deploy_testnet.sh
```

### Run Demo

Follow the step-by-step guide in [demo/demo-script.md](demo/demo-script.md)

## 🎓 Smart Contract API

### Group Management
```rust
create_group(contribution_amount, cycle_duration, max_members) -> u64
get_group(group_id) -> Group
list_members(group_id) -> Vec<Address>
```

### Membership
```rust
join_group(group_id)
is_member(group_id, address) -> bool
```

### Contributions
```rust
contribute(group_id)
get_contribution_status(group_id, cycle_number) -> Vec<(Address, bool)>
```

### Payouts
```rust
execute_payout(group_id)
is_complete(group_id) -> bool
```

## 🧪 Testing

Comprehensive test suite covering:
- ✅ Group creation and configuration
- ✅ Member joining and validation
- ✅ Contribution flow and tracking
- ✅ Payout rotation and distribution
- ✅ Group completion lifecycle
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases

Run tests:
```bash
cargo test
```

## 🌍 Why This Matters

**Financial Inclusion**: Over 1.7 billion adults globally are unbanked. Ajo/Esusu has served African communities for generations as a trusted savings mechanism.

**Blockchain Benefits**:
- No need for a trusted coordinator
- Transparent contribution and payout history
- Programmable rules enforced by smart contracts
- Accessible to anyone with a Stellar wallet

**Target Users**:
- African diaspora communities
- Unbanked/underbanked populations
- Small business owners needing working capital
- Communities building financial discipline


## 🗺️ Roadmap

- **v1.0** (Current): XLM-only groups, basic functionality
- **v1.1**: Custom token support (USDC, EURC, etc.)
- **v2.0**: Flexible payout schedules, penalty mechanisms
- **v3.0**: Frontend UI with wallet integration
- **v4.0**: Mobile app, fiat on/off-ramps

See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) for details.
